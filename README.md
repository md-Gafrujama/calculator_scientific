Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the calculator layout.
CSS3: Styling for the calculator interface, responsive design, and animations.
JavaScript (ES6): Core functionality for handling the calculator logic and operations.
Code Structure

----
├── index.html        # The main HTML file that defines the calculator layout.
├── styles.css        # CSS file for styling the calculator interface.
└── script.js         # JavaScript file handling calculator logic and operations.
index.html: Contains the structure of the calculator, including buttons for digits, operations, and advanced functions.
styles.css: Defines the look and feel of the calculator, ensuring it is user-friendly and responsive on different screen sizes.
script.js: Includes the core logic for processing calculator inputs, managing operations, and updating the display.
How It Works
The calculator works by capturing user input via buttons or keyboard events, processing the inputs using JavaScript, and displaying the result in the output screen.

Key steps include:

Basic Operations: The calculator uses the JavaScript eval() function to evaluate mathematical expressions, ensuring that calculations follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS).
Trigonometric & Logarithmic Functions: Advanced functions like Math.sin(), Math.log(), and Math.pow() are used for computations.
Error Handling: The code checks for invalid inputs (such as division by zero) and displays error messages accordingly.
